                    <p1>Taal Volcano is located in the province of Batangas, on the island of Luzon in the Philippines. It sits within Taal Lake, a large freshwater lake formed by previous volcanic activity.</p1>
                    <br><br>
                    <p2>Taal Volcano is part of a volcanic chain on Luzon formed over 500,000 years ago by tectonic collisions. 
                        It is the smallest active volcano in the world and is uniquely situated on Volcano Island nestled within the vast caldera of Lake Taal. 
                        Since the 16th century, over 30 eruptions have been recorded, ranging from minor events confined to Volcano Island to catastrophic episodes that have claimed more than 5,000 lives, earning Taal the designation of a Decade Volcano. 
                        A notable 1911 eruption reshaped the crater lake to form Vulcan Point, the largest island within a lake on an island within a lake.
                        Its history serves as a reminder of the dynamic and ever-changing nature of the Earth.<cite><a href="https://www.taalvolcano.org/history/" target="_blank">(History - Hiking Taal Volcano | Day Tours From Manila, 2017)</a></cite>

                    <p3>I chose this place because it is the volcano in our province of Batangas. 
                        As someone who frequently travels between Batangas and Manila, I always find the view breathtaking.
                        The view of it gets even more beautiful in some places in tagaytay especially because of the perfect cone called "<em>Binintiang Malaki</em>". </p3>
